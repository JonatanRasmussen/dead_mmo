I am making a 2D game using the Pygame framework.
There is no camera. The entire playable area is visible on the screen at all times.
There is only a single level. There is no main menu or scene switching.
Player movement is clamped such that moving off the screen is impossible.
Inside the playable area there are no walls or obstacles.
The player is a blue colored circle that can be moved using WASD.
To support all screen sizes, the player can move from -1 to 1 in x and y (floats).
At the top of the screen is a red colored circle which is the enemy.
The player can cast one of three abilities by pressing Q, E and R.
There is a 1-second global cooldown before another ability can be cast.
The player can press Q to cast their ability and damage the enemy.
The size of the player and the enemy is proportional to their HP.
When the player or enemy takes damage, their circle should get smaller.
Similarly, when HP is gained, their circle should get bigger.
Any HP loss should spawn several tiny circles proportional to the damage taken.
Walking over these tiny circles causes the player to consume them and gain HP.
An example: The player presses Q, dealing 10 damage to the (stationary) enemy.
Now, the enemy shrinks and spawn 5 tiny circles, each of which restores 2 hp.
The player walks over these tiny circles, consuming them and growing 10 hp.
